#### Bacteria Comparison Using k-mer Frequencies
Developed a high-performance application to compare bacterial proteomes based on k-mer frequency analysis. The tool calculates the stochastic probability of 6-mers, 5-mers, and amino acids to determine bacterial similarity.

The project utilized a tech stack that includes C++, OpenMP, High-Performance Computing (HPC), and Docker. The parallelization was achieved using both explicit and implicit multi-threading with OpenMP, optimizing computational tasks. Additionally, Windows threads were used for task distribution across cores.

The outcome of the project was a significant performance improvement, with a speedup curve generated by testing on various core configurations in HPC environments. This solution is capable of handling large datasets efficiently, speeding up bacterial comparison and facilitating phylogenetic tree construction.
